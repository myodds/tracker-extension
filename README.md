# Bet Tracker extension
**Chrome extension for https://myodds.bet/tracker.**
Add bets to the tracker directly from different betting sites.

The extension is not possible to install directly from Google Chrome Store because it's gambling-related and Google doesn't allow it. That's why the source code is placed here on Github and not in the store. Follow simple steps for installation to your browser:

 1. Click on the green button *Code*. 
 2. Select Download ZIP. 
 3. Unzip the downloaded file to an empty folder. 
 4. Open Extensions in Chrome (copy *chrome://extensions/* to URL or go to menu -> more tools -> extensions).
 5. Allow developer mode in the top right corner.
 6. Press button *Load unpacked* and choose folder with unzipped extension.
 7. You should see Bet Tracker in extensions now.
